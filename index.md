## Web Content & Site Management Experience

I work daily in WordPress and occasionally in other platforms like Joomla and Shopify. My Joomla work focuses mainly on migrating sites into WordPress for its wider theme options, stronger plugin support, and more active development. For Shopify, I handle integration with WordPress and store migrations to WooCommerce.

In WordPress, I work with a wide variety of themes, page builders, plugins, and third-party tools to support flexible layouts, structured content, and advanced functionality. I also customize themes and plugins, and build custom plugins as needed.

### Examples of Work

- **Event & Calendar Management**  
  Configured and customized event/class calendars for <a href="https://lebanonwilsonchamber.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lebanon Wilson Chamber</a>, [**Visit Wilson County**](https://visitwilsoncounty.com/), and [**Sunshine Weaving**](https://sunshineweaving.com/product-category/class/).

- **End-to-End Site Builds**  
  Designed and developed solo projects including [**Care We Are**](https://careweare.com) and [**Elrod Stud Welding**](https://elrodstudwelding.com) with custom layout and functionality.

- **Custom Development**  
  Extended builder capabilities and developed or modified plugins for [**PhilPrint**](https://philprint.com), [**First Freedom Bank**](https://firstfreedombank.com), [**Mid-South Color Labs**](https://midsouthcolor.com/), and [**Plann Well**](https://plannwell.com/) to meet specific business and usability needs.

- **Platform Migrations**  
  Migrated sites from Joomla to WordPress for [**UCEMC**](https://ucemc.com) and [**CedarStone Bank**](https://cedarstonebank.com), involving content restructuring, theme redevelopment, and SEO preservation.


This range of work reflects both my ability to manage routine content workflows and my flexibility to work effectively across a wide range of platforms and technical environments.

## Email Marketing Experience

While email isn’t my sole focus, I regularly support it as part of broader digital strategies, especially where websites, forms, CRMs, and campaign data intersect. I’ve designed and adapted responsive email templates in Mailchimp and connected forms to platforms like Mailchimp and Zoho, using tools such as Zapier or native integrations to automate workflows and reduce manual data handling.

In addition to technical setup, I support campaign tracking and reporting through Bit.ly and Google Analytics, helping teams monitor link performance, email engagement, and user behavior across platforms. I also configure UTM parameters to ensure accurate source tracking and reporting in GA.

For the past three years, I’ve served as technical lead for the [**Tennessee State Parks Conservancy fundraiser**](https://tnstateparksconservancy.org/my-tn-state-park-fundraiser/). I’ve managed the backend setup for their multi-platform campaign; integrating Mailchimp, Kindful, Bloomerang, and Zapier to ensure donor activity triggers targeted email sequences. I’ve also supported campaign link tracking using Bit.ly and configured UTM parameters for Google Analytics to monitor and report on traffic sources, user behavior, and conversions.
